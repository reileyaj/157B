    <h2>The Reckless Policies that Helped Fill our Streets with Ridiculously Large Cars</h2>
    <p class="citation">Zipper, David. “The Reckless Policies That Helped Fill Our Streets with Ridiculously Large Cars.” Vox, 28 Apr. 2024, www.vox.com/future-perfect/24139147/suvs-trucks-popularity-federal-policy-pollution.</p>
    <p>
        In this article, Zipper comprehensively explains why and how daily vehicles in the U.S. have grown so large. He coins this phenomenon 'car bloat'. Americans prefer bigger vehicles for a number of reasons: they <em>seem</em> safer, they give drivers a better view of traffic further ahead of them (costing them the view of what is directly in front of them), and they have more storage capacity. Car bloat isn't just caused by consumers, car manufacturers have had a hand in it, too. 
        <br><br>
        Pickup trucks, SUVs, and Minivans aren't technically classified as cars, but light trucks. These vehicles have looser emission regulations, and car manufacturers advertised these in the 80's and 90's to capitalize on this loophole. Nowadays, EVs are assumed to not create any emissions (even though fossil fuels still make up most U.S. energy production) which allows these cars to be much heavier and more wasteful with inefficient batteries. Zipper also mentions other reasons, such as tariffs for European cars, tax loopholes for heavy cars, and the frozen-since-1993 gas tax. Furthermore, vehicle safety ratings fail to inform consumers about the dangers these large cars and light trucks pose to those outside the car.
        <br><br>
        It's hard to reverse car bloat because American car manufacturers enjoy big profits from big vehicles, partially because of stifled competition from abroad and the light-truck loophole. However, there is some pushback. States like California and Colorado are proposing weight-based registration fees, which would dissuade consumers from buying light trucks.

    <h2>Safety for Whom? The Effects of Light Trucks on Traffic Fatalities</h2>
    <p class="citation">Anderson, Michael. “Safety for whom? The effects of light trucks on traffic fatalities.” Journal of health economics vol. 27,4 (2008): 973-989. doi:10.1016/j.jhealeco.2008.02.001</p>
    <p>
        In this article, Anderson studdies how the rise of light trucks in the U.S. has impacted traffic safety. He first acknowledges that what makes a light truck a light truck also makes it more dangerous: poor visibility and maneuverability increase the likelihood of getting into a crash in the first place; high center of gravity makes them prone to rolling over; their height and stiff frames make them more likely to ride on top of a colliding car. 
        <br><br>
        In his findings, Anderson discovers that a 1% increase in the light truck population can cause 143 deaths per year. About a four-fifths of these deaths are those outside the light truck: people in other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. In short, light trucks cause more deaths to those outside the vehicle without being substantially safer than a car for the passengers inside.

    <h2>Vehicles with Higher, More Vertical Front Ends Pose Greater Risk to Pedestrians</h2>
    <p class="citation">“Vehicles with Higher, More Vertical Front Ends Pose Greater Risk to Pedestrians.” IIHS, 14 Nov. 2023, www.iihs.org/news/detail/vehicles-with-higher-more-vertical-front-ends-pose-greater-risk-to-pedestrians.</p>
    <p>
        This article brings to light data on the danger of vehicles with blunt profiles and tall front ends. Specifically, vehicles (often light trucks) with hoods higher than 40 inches are approximately 45% more likely to cause death in pedestrian crashes than their shorter counterparts. This is because these taller, blunter models hit pedestrians in the torso, and are more likely to push them forward and run them over. This is in comparison to shorter cars, which are more likely to injure the legs and have the pedestrian fall onto the hood of the car.

    <h2>More than 15,000 Stakeholders Call for Updating Misleading and Dangerous Federal Vehicle Safety Ratings</h2>
    <p class="citation">“More than 15,000 Stakeholders Call for Updating Misleading and Dangerous Federal Vehicle Safety Ratings: NACTO.” National Association of City Transportation Officials, 4 Apr. 2023, nacto.org/2022/06/09/15000-call-for-update-to-ncap/.</p>
    <p>
        This article calls for a change in U.S. vehicle safety ratings, pointing out one glaring flaw: current safety ratings only take into account the safety of those <em>inside </em>the car. With traffic deaths on the rise, the U.S. has the highest rate of auto fatalities in the industrialized world. The article suggests that the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) considers pedestrian safety by withholding 5-star ratings for vehicles that score poorly on pedestrian safety, have poor visibility from the driver's seat (without help from sensors and cameras), lack intelligent speed assistance, and cannot sense and automatically brake for pedestrians.
