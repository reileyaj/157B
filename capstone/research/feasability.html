            <h2>3D Models</h2>
            <p>The most important feature I want to add is <b>3D models</b>. I will build these in <b>Blender</b> and implement this using <b>three.js</b>; I think I tackled the worst of three.js in my Library Liberty project, though I would also like to add small animations in my models, which I will have to experiment with. </p>
            <p>A stretch goal for this would be to utilize <b>three-pathfinding</b>, a pathfinding library that works under three.js. I attempted to do this while working on Library Liberty, but the problem I ran into wasn't with the code itself, but that the Blender software, <b>UPBGE Blender</b>, that generated the navigation mesh wasn't compatable with my computer. I have an additional laptop that I had lent to a friend at the time that I want to try this software out on, but I am hesitant to sink too much time into it in case I can't figure it out soon enough.</p>

            <h2>Switching Between Speculative Designs</h2>
            <p>Since I am focusing my project around speculative design, I want to explore different paths that car/pedestrian-centric infrastructure and vehicle design can take. The ideas themselves will be built in rendered with three.js, but I want users to be able to <b>smoothly switch between these designs at any time</b>. I may be able to do this with css animations, but since those are tricky and time-consuming for me, I may employ the help of <b>anime.js</b>. </p>
