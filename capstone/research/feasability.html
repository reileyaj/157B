            <h2>3D Models</h2>
            <p>The most important feature I want to add is <b>3D models</b>. I will build these in <b>Blender</b> and implement this using <b>three.js</b>; I think I tackled the worst of three.js in my Library Liberty project, though I would also like to add small animations in my models, which I will have to experiment with. </p>

            <h2>Switching Between 'Realities'</h2>
            <p>Since I am focusing my project around speculative design, I want to explore different paths that car/pedestrian-centric infrastructure and vehicle design can take. The ideas themselves will be built in rendered with three.js, but I want users to be able to <b>smoothly switch between these designs at any time</b>. I should be able to either do this through css animations or with the added help of <b>anime.js</b>. </p>
