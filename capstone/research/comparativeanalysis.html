        <h1>Comparative Analysis</h1>
        <p>I'm going to be comparing two sites that deal with measurements, as one a focus of my project is going to be measuring cars and illustrating how their height can cause deadly blind spots.</p>

        <h2>Carsized</h2>

        <p><a href="https://www.carsized.com/en/">Carsized.com</a> is a great resource available to compare the dimensions of cars. The site allows users to browse from an extensive list of models and view the two cars side-by-side.</p>

        <h2>Dimensions</h2>
        <img src="images/dimensions.jpg" alt="an image of a website showing 2d dimensions of an Eames office chair, as well as text descriptions of the chair and a 3D model">
        <p><a href="https://www.dimensions.com/">Dimensions.com</a> is something I use a lot when 3D modelling in Blender. It has a seemingly endless list of articles describing the dimensions of everything from a Eames office chair (pictured above) to a Xenomorph. <br>

                    <li>Supplies detailed list of dimensions and other background information.</li>
