      <h1>Today, USA</h1>
      <p id="h1">Are we using the full potential of our space today? Cars and the space we reserve for them take up a lot of space.</p>

      <section class="sec right" id="sec1">
        <h2>Smaller Cars</h2>
        <p>Something like this red sedan is probably what you think of when you think of a car, and it is one! Safer than larger cars, in a collision this car would push a pedestrian onto the hood of the car. Personal cars like this can be wasteful of space and resources, especially when only transporting one person. </p>

      <section class="sec left" id="sec2">
        <h2>Space Dedicated to Cars</h2>
        <p>How many parking lots are in your city? An average of 22% of space is given to parking in American cities with a population over 1 million. With housing and third place shortages in many cities, maybe this space could be better utilized!</p>
      </section>
      <section class="sec right" id="sec3">
        <h2>Large Cars</h2>
        <p>Personal vehicles like this blue truck have been getting larger and larger in the U.S. A subset of these vehicles, classified as light trucks (pickup trucks and SUVs), have different safety regulations under U.S. law. These vehicles tend to be getting larger, which reduces driver visibility, and taller, which, in a collision with a pedestrian, is more likely to push them under the vehicle rather than onto the hood of the vehicle. This is much more dangerous for the pedestrian.</p>

      <section class="sec left" id="sec4">
        <h2>Pedestrian Travel</h2>
        <p>Have you ever tried to get around without a car? Depending on where you were, it might have been a piece of cake or an arduous journey. Although the vast majority of Americans have a driver's license, not everyone has a car, and not everyone wants one! Unfortunately, public transit and infrastructure, such as sidewalks and bikelanes, are severely lacking in most areas.</p>
