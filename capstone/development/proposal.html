    <h1>Capstone Proposal</h1>    
    <h2>Topic</h2>
    <p>	I’m very excited to explore how cars have shaped American infrastructure and how this negatively affects Americans. This happens through many avenues: for drivers, things like traffic, expensive/not enough parking and gas prices and emissions can be main concerns, while non-drivers suffer from lack of infrastructure catered to them and the danger of being hit by vehicles that are only growing in size. My target audience is Americans (most of whom drive!) as I want to change ways of thinking around existing infrastructure. I haven’t met anyone in class whose topic of interest aligns with mine, but if I do, I’d be more than happy to work with them! 
    </p>
    <h2>Lenses</h2>
    <p>As that may suggest, I am interested in challenging mental models about car necessity and creating speculative designs about life with fewer (or even totally without) cars. Does every person or household really need one or more cars? What would U.S. life look like if we allocated more land, money, and priority to public transit? How would non-drivers' lives change? In other words, the way things are surrounding the amount of cars, roads, freeways, and parking vs. availability of public transport, bike lanes, crosswalks and even sidewalks doesn’t need to be the way it is.
    </p>
    <p> I also want to explore visualizing data surrounding death, injury, and emissions caused by cars and light trucks (which are legally different than cars, but both are personal vehicles that are operated on the same roads by the same people), as well as present any correlation there may be with how vehicles have increased in size over time. Exploring why this happened (and how it can be reversed!) also interests me. Some other data I’d like to visualize are blind spots and how they increase with the height of a vehicle and how public transit compares across the U.S. and maybe even abroad. 
    </p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Possible Features</h2>
    <p>A feature that I’m interested in pursuing is a simulation of the view through the drivers’ seat of different models of cars to demonstrate how blind spots directly in front of the vehicle grow dangerously large as the vehicle gets bigger. I think it would be effective to have 3-4 people of varying heights walk in front of the car as if it was stopped at an intersection, so the user can see how tall one might have to be to be seen above the blind spot, and how dangerous, especially for children, that large vehicles can be.  
    </p>
    <p>I’m also interested in looking at how the space roads and parking garages take up could be more effectively used for public transportation, among other uses. Could a parking garage be transformed into public housing? A library? Could a highway give way to a high-speed rail line? How would this change life for drivers and non-drivers? I could visualize this data both through maps and illustrations. 
    </p>
    <h2>Possible Hindrances</h2>
    <p>The driver’s seat simulation I mentioned above may face challenges. I’d like for the user to be able to look around (similar to how one can with Google Maps) but I’m unsure of how plausible that is for me to complete. Even without the turn feature, I’m not totally sure of how I could efficiently upload screen-size images or videos without taking up too much space and making the page load too slowly. A stretch goal I have for this simulation is for the user to be able to “drive” straight forward and notice what they can and can’t see along the ride. In a Camry, the driver might be able to stop in time for a kid running out to get their basketball; a F-150 might struggle to see them. Again, not totally sure how I’d be able to achieve this.
